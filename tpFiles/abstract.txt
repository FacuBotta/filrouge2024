Abstract

Eventhub - Events and Appointments Management

The primary objective of this project is to provide users with a platform to manage the creation of events and appointments within a single, intuitive application. Users can create public events and share them with the entire community on the website, or create private events to share only with selected contacts. The messaging system allows users to efficiently communicate with contacts, and an interactive calendar makes the creation and management of events much easier. This calendar will be synchronized with the Google account of any user, enabling them to receive notifications for appointments across the Google ecosystem, including emails, smartphone pop-up notifications, and more.

Professionals can use the application to create appointments with their clients. Imagine a personal trainer who has appointments, messages, tasks, and notes scattered across different applications. With Eventhub, they can manage everything within the same application. They can share their availability on the website and propose open or private training sessions with their contacts.

But it's not just for professionals. Imagine you want to join a mushroom-foraging group in a new city but lack the knowledge to go alone. You can sign up for Eventhub, search for "mushrooms," and find several events created by other users in different locations. You can see the list of participants, event details, and comments. You can even post questions if needed. If you decide to join an event, you'll receive notifications about any changes. The rating and comment system between users and events ensures a level of security for community members. Users can report any issues, and the administration can take necessary actions, including closing accounts.

This application began as a study project but has the potential to become a practical and free solution for users to manage events and appointments.

Advantages:
